# BetterDebug

Better Debug plugin will help you speed up debugging by making displaying information much easier and faster than you thought possible. You will have available print nodes for all of the common types of variables (No more converting everything to string ðŸ˜‰) with always added option to describe your debug so you don't have to constantly worry about where is your "hello" coming from.

We also made for you brand new editor utility, so you can easily adjust the size of the prints together with categories of what you want to print, so no more text spam on your screen! Display only the information you need, when you need it.

You can also download BetterDebug from Epic marketplace:
